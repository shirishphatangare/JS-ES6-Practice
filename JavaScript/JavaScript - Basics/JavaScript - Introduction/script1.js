Scripts with <script> tag can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element or after <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display. 
You can even place <script> tag outside of <head> or <body> tags.
Browser has built-in JS engine which executes JS code. 
Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">. The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.
